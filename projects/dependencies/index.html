      <h3>NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1656958">III-1656958</a>: CRII: III: Scalable and Interactive Dependency Visualization to Accelerate Parallel Program Analysis</h3>

      <p>
Large-scale parallel programs are used to simulate and study weather patterns,
    vehicle design, combustion and energy. However, developing these and
optimizing these programs to be more accurate and efficient is difficult.
    Program analysts often investigate the <i>dependencies</i> within the
programs. The number of dependencies in such programs is vast, taxing visual
tools representing them. The goals of this project are developing visualization
approaches to overcome these challenges as well as design guidelines for
related large and complex data.

    <p><b>Current Results:</b>
	<ul class="mainul">
	    <li>A <a href="http://hdc.cs.arizona.edu/papers/gd_2019_spx_layout.pdf">domain-specific layout approach</a> for control flow dependency visualization which improves interperatability.</li>
	    <ul class="mainul">
		<li>While our visualization supported direct manipulation to tweak layout, we found researchers no longer prioritized that functionality once this layout was in place. Instead, they wanted to preserve the layout.
		</li>
	    </ul>
            <li>An <a href="http://github.com/hdc-arizona/cfgexplorer">open-source interactive visualization tool</a> for control flow dependencies and dyanmic traces.</li>
	    <li>A <a href="http://hdc.cs.arizona.edu/papers/cfg_2018_explorer_preprint.pdf">goal and task analysis</a> for visualizing control flow graphs in computing research.</li>
	    <ul class="mainul">
		<li>We found node-link visualizations were used first to debug the researchers' own mental models in anticipation of developing new algorithms and later in debugging their research in progress.
		</li>
		<li>Presenting and explaining their work to collaborators was another major goal in generating the visualization.</li>
             </ul>
	    <li>An optimization-based graph layout approach (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01769">Stress-Plus-X</a>) that balances multiple graph drawing criteria.</li>
	    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13135v4">guidelines for conducting design studies in rapidly moving projects</a> such as the software and research concerns targeted by this project.</li>
	    <li>An <a href="https://github.com/hdc-arizona/traveler-tree">open-source interactive visualization tool</a> for expression trees from an asynchronous task-based parallel runntime system.</li>
	    <li>A <a href="https://github.com/hdc-arizona/roundtrip">library for integrating Javascript utilities with Jupyter Notebook</a>, to pass data between in-cell Javascript visualizations with other cells in the notebook.
	</ul>

    <p><b>Impact:</b>
       <ul class="mainul">
	 <li><a href="http://github.com/hdc-arizona/cfgexplorer">CFGExplorer</a> is available publicly and has been used by a team of researchers at the University of Arizona for program analysis and optimization of scientific software and a team of researchers at Louisiana State University for loop parallelization.</li>
	 <li><a href="https://github.com/hdc-arizona/roundtrip">Roundtrip</a> is available publicly and has been used in Jupyter notebooks at Louisiana State University and NREL.</li>
	 <li><a href="https://github.com/hdc-arizona/traveler-tree">Atria</a> is available publicly and has been used for performancne tuning in an asynchronous task-based parallel runntime.
